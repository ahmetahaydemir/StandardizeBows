# StandardizeBows
Standardize Bows is a Unity ( C# ) project that is created in order to setup bow models that will simulate the physics of a bow without having any animation or animator component being attached to the bow. 

It is something that I currently use in my hobby project. I hope by sharing it, more people can benefit from it.

Also it might help to people who don't have any experience in animation :)

## Who should use this ?

⇛ If you are not experienced in a modelling software and you don't have the time and energy to learn them like I don't, **this asset is for you!**

⇛ If you are creating a game that has lots and lots of bow models, **this asset is for you!** 

⇛ If you want your player stats to affect and interact with the movement of the bows like in a RPG game, **this asset is for you!** 

## Who should not use this ?

⇝ **However,** because of the way this C# script achieves this process(not the most performant way), this script is not viable for a game that has more than 100 of these bows concurrently active in a scene ( Like a RTS game would have ).

# ❂ FEATURES ❂ 

► Realistic looking simulation of a bow being drawn and fired off. 

&nbsp;

![Standardize Bows](https://github.com/ahmetahaydemir/StandardizeBows/raw/master/img/StagesOfTheBow.png "Bow Simulation - Check out the showcase video") 

&nbsp;

► Three different types of script sets for your bows and projectiles. First one is the standalone version that doesn't require a bow user. Other two versions are developed in order to integrate the simulation of the bow with Humaoid character's animations. One with the animator states and the other one uses animator boolean parameters. 

&nbsp;

► Modular state like coding in order to allow users to easily add/remove functionality.

&nbsp;

► Projectile and particle object pooling.

&nbsp;

► Collision detection with different types of surfaces and on hit particles and sound effects.

&nbsp;

► Clear documentation and the scripts are heavily commented and organized.

## Roadmap

Feel free to suggest anything that you want to see in the future.

* **First thing I will be looking into will be the Vertex Deformation with a shader.** It would be much more performant and suitable for high amounts of instances. I didn’t write it that way thinking that it would be hard for me and users who don’t know how to write shaders to get most out of it. Because as long as an asset cannot be integrated into your project, it is a waste of time.

* **Second thing is the given bow models with the asset package.** I just put them as a placeholder models. They are my own models and that’s why they look terrible. I am planning to commission an artist friend of mine to create a set of bow and arrow models for this package depending on my financial state which is not very stable :)
